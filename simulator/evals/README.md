# Evaluations
This directory stores different simulation configuration files for different evaluations. The two configs in this folder, `plot_bday_schedule` and `plot_blend_schedule` are a good place to start; they generate plots of two nodes' schedules for a short sim run. If you wish to dig deeper, each subdirectory contains the more involved simulation configurations used in the paper.

Each simulation outputs its results in `../results/data`.
